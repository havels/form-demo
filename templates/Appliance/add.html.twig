    <h1>Add appliance</h1>

    <p>An appliance has a single, optional attachment. The attachment type is similar to a conventional file
        field but it will remember your upload even if there is a validation error elsewhere in the form.
        You can test this by leaving the name field blank.</p>

    <p>Internally, the file is always saved to the file uploads directory, and the form comes back with a hidden field
        containing metadata about the saved file. This metadata includes an HMAC for security.</p>

    {{ form_start(form) }}
        {{ form_row(form.name) }}
        {{ form_row(form.manual) }}
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-floppy-save"></i> Save</button>
    {{ form_end(form) }}
